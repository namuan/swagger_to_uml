# Swagger to UML

A small pure Python script that converts [OpenAPI specifications](https://www.openapis.org) (a.k.a. [Swagger](https://swagger.io)) into [Plant UML](http://plantuml.com) diagrams. 
The goal is not to replace existing documentation generators, but to complement them with a visual representation of the routes, models, and their relationships.

## Example

![excerpt of the petstore example](petstore_example/swagger.png)

To create a diagram from the [petstore example](http://petstore.swagger.io), call the script with:

```
python3 bin/swagger_to_uml petstore_example/swagger.json >petstore_example/swagger.puml
```

It will create the file `petstore_example/swagger.puml` which can then be translated into a PNG image with PlantUML with:

```
plantuml petstore_example/swagger.puml -tpng
```

Note you need to install [Plant UML](http://plantuml.com) and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) for this.

## Installation

The script runs with Python 3 without any additional packages. 
Transforming PUML into vector graphics or other requires external tools however.

On macOS, the installation of the required tools with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is simple:

```
brew install plantuml graphviz
```

## Contribute

The script is just a first proof-of-concept version. Issues and pull requests welcome!
